title: A guide to asking the right questions for noob data scientists - Part 1
---

The TLDR essence of this series of articles is that the [business model canvas](https://strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas) (and associated canvases on the [business model environment](http://blog.strategyzer.com/posts/2015/10/14/how-to-scan-through-your-environments-disruptive-threats-and-opportunities) and the [value proposition](https://strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas)) can be incredibly useful in unlocking a data scientist’s potential when entering business or transitioning to a new industry because it encourages a better understanding of how their company creates, delivers, and stores values. This in turn enables them to better assess the relative importance and possible consequences of different questions and increases the likelihood that they’ll ask the right question.

Unlike the common assumption in game theory, we do not live in a world of common knowledge and moreover none of us is omniscient. Instead, all of us is limited to by what we know and understanding of a particular set of things is typically clustered into groups for which it is relevant. Each of us belongs to different sets of “universes:”  the universe of parents, universe of soccer players, universe of bartenders, knitters, models, or anxious people… These universes have intersections when someone may be a parent and a soccer player and are semi-permeable as parents can be friends of soccer players or be exposed to soccer players on television. Moreover, these universes can exist in near isolation despite extreme physical proximity: the nuclear physicist married to the english professor specializing in Lord Byron. Biologists are predisposed to know a lot more about the world’s organisms than engineers, designers, and the general public at large. While an biologist may have information that’s uniquely relevant to a particular problem for a professional in a different field, that connection may not occur for various reasons. Even if a single professional learns the particularly relevant example, the degree and speed by which that knowledge might spread to the larger community of professionals (and potentially the larger global community) will depend on another host of reasons. An example is the idea behind biomimicry where once biological discoveries in the “natural technology” of animals is being ‘rediscovered’ by other types of professionals and laymen and subsequently being applied to new problems outside the realm of biology. In a very general way, we can see this spread of knowledge by the increased use of the term “biomimicry” in printed literature since 1980:

Okay, what’s this got to do with data science you might say? Besides lightly raising the idea of information flow and networks (which I will go into more formally in later articles), it raises another set of ideas related to knowledge gaps and knowledge imbalances between different sets of people. This series of articles raises three main knowledge gaps and imbalances which I perceive as existing in the world today. In particular:

1. The why and how of data science: companies which believe they need data scientists and if they know what to do with them.

2. Different roles but same name / different names but same role: what is a data scientist and the search for unicorns in a world of inconsistent and ambiguous names 

3. Creating unicorns: if there are no candidates with the golden triumphant of qualifications, how to create one.

Given that much has been written about the first two, I focus on the last one where I offer a solution (or at least an aid) in remedying the dearth of data scientists who typically have programming, statistics, and domain knowledge in the industry they are entering. In so doing, I myself act as a bridge between the startup universe where the tool is commonly used and the data science universe where little focus seems to be spent talking about the business domain that we may operate in.
