Zhanna is the creator of Hindsight, a tool to facilitate self-discovery and drive behavior. In its essence, Hindsight aims to reclaim the present moment in pursuit of a person’s deepest values. Hindsight collects biometric, environmental, and other personal data across a person’s digital footprint, applies machine learning methods to understand a person’s ongoing behavior in real terms, and then considers gamification and behavior change research to deliver/communicate insights to the person at optimal times and forms. 

Zhanna currently works as a data scientists at Kaplan Test Prep and is active in NY's meetup culture. She organizes for Habit Design New York, a group that synthesizes applied research across a wide range of habit designers and delivers best practices in developing sustainable daily habits. More broadly, Zhanna is interested in how data science, old and new technologies (AR/VR, IoT, and wearable devices) and discoveries from academic fields like neuroscience and psychology, can be brought together to further human improvement.
